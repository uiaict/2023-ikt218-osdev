bits 32 ; Declares that the assembler should generate 32-bit code. This is an assembler directive.


MULTIBOOT_MAGIC     equ 0x1BADB002  ; Magic number that the bootloader will be looking for, according to the multiboot specification.
MULTIBOOT_FLAGS     equ 0x0  ;   Flags, currently not using this.
MULTIBOOT_CHECKSUM  equ -(MULTIBOOT_MAGIC + MULTIBOOT_FLAGS)   ; Checksum. Negated sum of magic number + flags, as sum of checksum + magic number and flags needs to equal 0.

KERNEL_STACK_SIZE equ 0x4000 ; Defines the size of our stack, 16KB. We will use this definition further down in the assembly code.



; This defines the multiboot header to be located by the bootloader, GRUB.

    ;; Instead, it is an assembler directive to define a 32-bit value. 
    ;; Can be compared to how a preprocessor in languages such as C and C++ works.
