# 🔠 Standard Library
This module contains implementations of some of the functionality from the C standard library.
Most of the source code here was part of the inital template. Group 7, added the following:

## 🖨️ Printf
A printf function cabable of printing letters and variables like char, int and newline and %, as well as decide the color of the printed text. We also had to implement **strcpy**, **strlen** and **itoa** to make
the printf function work.

## 💻 Clear screen
We implemented a function to clear the screen, that removes all content on the screen when called and sets
the cursor at the top left of the screen.

## ⏫ Reverse
The reverse function reverses a string. **Swap** was also implemented to make the reverse function work. Swap swaps the location of two letters.
