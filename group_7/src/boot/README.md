# ðŸ‘¢ Boot
The boot module contains the files that implements the boot process. The majority of the
content of these files was already here as part of the inital template for the project.

This project uses GRUB for booting, and multiboot is enabled.


Group 7, our group, implemented multiboot in this module, by adding some assembly code to the boot.asm,
largely inspired by the course material. For more detail about the this, check the report and the comments
provided in each file.
