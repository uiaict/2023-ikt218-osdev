# üñ•Ô∏è UIA OS Group 7
This is the source code used by group 7 to implement the UIA OS and all the 
assignments given to us in the course IKT218G23V Avanserte Operativsystemer.
The project consists of the following modules, which all has their own 
readme documentation.

- **kernel**
- **boot**
- **stdlib**
- **arch**

The **arch** module sets up the x64 archiceture and is untouched by group 7. The majority of our work is done in the **kernel** module, where we have implemented some tables, interupts etc, and 
in the **stdlib**, where essential functions, like *malloc* and *printf* found in the standard c library is implmeneted in UIA OS.

## ‚ùï NOTE
For detailed documentation and code explaination, see
the source code itself, as all functions and operations is well documented there.


All documentation in this project was written by the members of group 7 or 
by the instructor PerArne.
